/**
 * Secret scrubbing. Everything this process writes to stderr, and every message
 * that reaches an error class, goes through here first.
 *
 * The bridge runs inside a desktop MCP client, so its stderr is captured into a
 * log file the user is likely to paste into a support ticket. A key that leaks
 * once into that file is a key that has to be rotated, and the person pasting it
 * will not notice. Two layers, because either one alone has a hole:
 *
 *   1. A shape rule that catches anything that looks like a Pinlyx key, even
 *      one this process was never given (a key pasted into a tool argument, a
 *      key echoed back inside an upstream error body).
 *   2. An exact-value rule for the key this process IS holding, which covers a
 *      key that does not match the shape (a future format, an operator-issued
 *      token) at the cost of remembering the literal.
