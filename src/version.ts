 * Package version, reported in `--version`, in the MCP `serverInfo` this bridge

 * Kept as a literal rather than read from package.json at runtime: the built
 * bundle is loaded by `npx` from wherever npm unpacked it, and resolving a
 * sibling package.json from a bundled ESM file is one more thing that can fail
 * in a user's environment for no benefit. CI checks it against package.json
 * before publishing, so the two cannot drift.
