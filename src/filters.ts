/**
 * Local surface filters, applied to every list before it leaves this process and
 * again on every call before it reaches the network.
 *
 * The filters exist because the remote key is coarse and the local context is
 * not. One `csk_live_...` key carries whatever scopes its owner gave it, but the
 * assistant sitting on the other end of stdio may only be trusted with part of
 * that: a content-planning session has no business sending DMs, and a research
 * session has no business writing at all. `--tools` and `--read-only` let the
 * person editing their MCP config narrow one key per client without minting a
 * second key.
 *
 * Both filters are enforced twice, and that is deliberate. Hiding a tool from
 * `tools/list` is advice; a model that saw the name once in an earlier turn can
 * still call it. The check in {@link assertToolAllowed} is the enforcement.

 * this package was published, which is the worst possible failure for a bridge.
 *
 * Order matters where names overlap. `crm_list_social_posts` and
 * `crm_social_post_stats` are both social AND posts; the contract splits them
 * on scope (`posts:read` / `posts:write` versus `social:*`), so the post rules
